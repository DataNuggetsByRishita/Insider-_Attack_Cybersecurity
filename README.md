# Insider-_Attack_Cybersecurity
Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting insider threats using machine learning techniques applied to behavioral and network activity data. Insider attacks pose significant risks to organizations due to their subtle and often legitimate-looking patterns. The objective of this project is to build a predictive system capable of identifying anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious intent.

The solution integrates data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and detailed documentation to provide a comprehensive threat detection framework.

Problem Statement

Insider threats are difficult to detect because malicious activities are often performed by authorized users with legitimate access. Traditional rule-based security systems may fail to capture subtle behavioral deviations.

This project addresses that challenge by applying machine learning models to identify abnormal activity patterns and classify potential insider threats.
